# PantherBot
Delivery robot for the FIU Engineering building

Online orders are a common commodity that most people use. These orders, while convenient, are still very inefficient. The package still requires extra effort from both the delivery person and the customer to finish the delivery in a multistory building. The PantherBot aims to solve this problem.
The PantherBot is an autonomous robot that can deliver the package directly to the customer regardless of the location of the customer.
